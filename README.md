## Hardware setup
Typical setup of the experiment consists of a number of interconnected nodes, each consisting of one or multiple KORUZA Pro units, test network equipment and sensors. Detailed setup is optimized for each experiment.

## Measurement processing and handling
The experiment is designed such that all significant events are captured and the data volume is minimized. The standard setup consists of a data point for every variable every 60s - [Implementation details](https://github.com/IRNAS/sfp-nodewatcher-agent)
 * FSO system variables - measurement every 0.5s, values aggregated every 60s into: -  [Implementation details](https://github.com/IRNAS/sfp-driver)
   * Variable minimum
   * Variable maximum
   * Variable average
   * Variable variance - (take square root for std deviation)
 * FSO link variables
   * Nominal value over the 60s interval reported
 * Control system variables
   * Nominal value reported 
 * Accelerometer variables -  [Implementation details](https://github.com/IRNAS/koruza-accelerometer-module)
   * Raw accelerometer values acquired for 4s, fourier analysed for frequency ranges then for every 60s calculated:
     * Variable minimum (typically not displayed)
     * Variable maximum
     * Variable average
  * Environmental variables
    * Nominal value reported

## Online real-time monitoring platform Nodeawtcher
Platform Nodewatcher is utilized to join all the measurements in an user-friendly interface, enabling real-time monitoring of the experiment, custom time-range data inspection and export for analysis. The above listed variables are measured as described and displayed on the graphs, samples of which are shown here along with a short introduction of what useful information about the operation we may be able to deduce from them. These data is collected from units connected to monitoring platform https://kw.koruza.net. 

## Sample graphs and information on potential results
Hereby we display sample graphs for a few hours of system operation and discuss what we may be able to see from them.

### RX optical power
RX optical power is the measure of optical intensity at the receiver as per SFP MSA standard. Note there may be absolute offset of up to 3dB in these measurements when correlated to 1 mW and thus it is not unusual to observe a unit may be receiving more then the opposite unit is transmitting. Variation in the intensity as such is what we are usually most interested in. From these values we may observe a number of things, most notably if both Average and Maximum/Minimum values are changing consistently, then the link is stable but may be affected by slow thermal movements of structures it is mounted on. Provided there are significant differences between minimum and maximum, then the link is experiencing either mechanical vibration at receive or transmit side or turbulence in the optical channel as such. The separate graph of Variance can be used to investigate how much the values have been chancing over the reporting period.

Typical values for KORUZA Pro are -6dBm to -20dBm for an operational link without packet loss. Same values are shown on two graphs, one in dB scale and one in mW scale. Variance is plotted separately.

### TX optical power and bias
TX optical power and bias current are observed to make sure output is constant and no significant variations are expected, except small currections in bias with the changes in temperature.

### Transceiver temperature and VCC
Transceiver temperature and vcc are monitored to observe the performance of the system under varying conditions, mainly temperature. Vcc is expected to be about 3300mV and Temperature typically ranges from 30 to 70 degree Celsius.

### Packet loss and RTT
Packet loss and RTT are measured over the wireless optical link to monitoring its performance over time and correlate events where there is notable packet loss to other environmental factors. For example here we can observe two events with some packet loss for a brief period of time, which correspond to loss in optical power shown above.

### Motor position
Motor position indicates the actual position of the motors inside KORUZA Pro unit, which is changed either manually though the web interface or automatically is a tracking algorithm is operating.

### System info
The information from the Raspberry Pi Compute module board running Raspbian Linux is shown here to evaluate for possible software issues, generally observable are memory leaks or significant system load events.

### Accelerometer
Accelerometer module may be used to correlated the link performance to mechanical stability. From these measurement we can deduce how stably KORUZA Pro is mounted and if link performance has been degraded due to the stability. Measurements are split in 4 user-defined frequency ranges, R1 to R4, that enable one to focus on particular range of frequencies.

### Weather
Weather is observed via a wireless weather station best mounted next to one of the KORUZA Pro units and the values are monitored. From temperature and humidity we may evaluate the FSO channel disturbances and predict fog events, wind may affect the stability of the system, rain may introduce temporary fade events and UV irradiance may be correlated to direct sunlight exposure and heating of the mechanical elements.
